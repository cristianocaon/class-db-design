# Movie Reviews Database

Project assignment for class CS 4354 (Concepts of Database Systems) with Dr. Abdul Serwadda, at Texas Tech University (Lubbock, TX).

The purpose was to create a Movie Review database using MySQL, where users can provide reviews (score and comments) about certain movies, which have information about their production that consists of the producers, directors, actors, writers and the publisher company financing the movie.
